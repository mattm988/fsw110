        <h1>What is the DOM?</h1>
        <p>The DOM is a programming interface for web documents.
           It represents the page so that programs can change the document 
           structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as 
           nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with 
           the page.</p>
